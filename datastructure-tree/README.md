Data structure - Tree

Notes:
	- Non linear data structure
	- Different variations are there in Tree
		a) Generic Tree
		b) Binary Tree
			1. Basic Binary Tree
			2. Binary Search Tree
			3. Left Skewed Binary Tree
			4. Right Skewed Binary Tree
			4. Threaded Binary Tree
		c) 2-3 Tree
		d) Red-Black Tree
		e) Splay Tree
		f) AVL Tree

Properties:-
	- Tree consist of nodes
	- All nodes connected with edges or paths
	- Root node - No parent
	- Child node - Has parent
	- Leaf node - No child
	- Internal node - Non-leaf nodes
	- External node - All leaf nodes 	
	
Traversal Mechanism:-
	- Two basic mechanism
		a) BFS - Breath First Search Traversal
		b) DFS - Depth First Search Traversal
	- As per above methods, different traversal are available
	- In order
	- Pre order
	- Post order
	- Level order
	- All traversals can be implemented in either recursive or iterative approach
