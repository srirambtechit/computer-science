<h3>Data structure - Tree related problems and its solutions</h3>

<b>BinaryTree problems:</b>
<pre>
 1. Calculate height of a node in tree
 2. Count number of full nodes in tree
 3. Count number of leaf/external nodes in tree
 4. Count number of internal nodes in tree
 5. Count number of nodes who has exactly 1 child and get those nodes
 6. Check tree S is a subtree of tree T
 7. Find size of a tree/number of nodes in tree
 8. Find a element in a tree
 9. Find max/min element in tree
10. Print the deepest node in tree

Traversal problems:
 1. Print the which level has maximum sum
 2. Find the depth of node
 3. Find the height of the tree
 4. Print "\n" after each level
 5. Create a separate list for each level
 6. Find two nodes are same level
 7. Find least common ancestor
 8. Find two nodes are cousin (They are same level but not same parent)
 9. Print the level wise data in zigzag order
10. Print the level wise data in reverse order (Right to left level traversal)
11. Print the root to leaf path
12. Print path for given sum
13. Find all the ancestor of the node
14. Find the diameter of the tree (Maximum distance between any two nodes)
15. Find the sum of vertical sum

Tree Comparisons:-
1. Identical tree (same data and structurally equals)
2. Mirror tree (Both tree has same node and children but the left exists on right side and right exists on left side)
3. Isometric tree (Structurally equals, data doesn't matter)
