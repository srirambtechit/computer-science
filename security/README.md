<h1>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<pre>
 - It is a protocol
 - establish secure communication between client & server
 - Implemented by data encryption and certification based authentication
 - almost all major browser supports this protocol
</pre>

<h3>Cryptography</h3>
<pre>
 - Technique used to transform human readable data into human not understandable format.
 - Basically it does encryption and decryption
 - Encryption = Message + Key = Cipher
 - Decryption = Cipher + Key = Message
 - Symmetric and Asymmetric cryptography fashions are there in general

 - <b>Symmetric key cryptography</b>
 - All people shares same key
 - There are 3 people A, B, C and a Key K
 - Suppose A wants to talk to B securely, he does below steps
    - A writes message say "Hello"
	- Encrypts with K + "Hello" -> Cipher
	- Sends over internet
	- B receives Cipher
	- Decrypts with K + Cipher -> Message
	- <b>Note:</b> Since common keys used here, C can also able to decrypt cipher, so 
	     no more security.

 - <b>Public key cryptography</b>.
 - There are 4 people A, B, C and D
 - People has following public/private keys
    - A -> Appk, Aprk
	- B -> Bppk, Bprk
	- C -> Cppk, Cprk
	- D -> Dppk, Dprk
 - Each knows public key of others whereas private key holds by concern person
 - Suppose A wants to talk to B securely, he does following steps
    - A writes message say "Hello"
	- Encrypts with Bppk + "Hello" -> scrambled form data (A_Cipher)
	- Sends over internet
	- B receives data
	- Decrypts by Bprk + A_Cipher -> A's Original message

<h3>Why SSL</h3>
<pre>
 - Encryption
 - Identification
</pre>

<h3>How SSL works</h3>
<pre>
 - <b>Encryption</b>: transforms sensitive data to some other format (which basically 
      third party can't understant) based on <b>public key encryptoin</b>.
 - <b>Identification</b>: ensures that the person we are talking is the one who we 
      intentially want to talk.
</pre>

<h3>Common Terminology</h3>
<pre>
 - <b>SSL</b>: Secure Scokets Layer
 - <b>TSL</b>: Transport Security Layer
 - <b>Cryptography</b>: Proposes various methodalogy for data transformation
 - <b>Encryption</b>: Converting into not human readable formate (Cipher text)
 - <b>Decryption</b>: Recovring message from cipher text
 - <b>Symmetric key</b>: A key used at sender and receiver end
 - <b>Asymmetric key</b>: Different key used at both the ends
 - <b>Public key</b>: A key which used by sender
 - <b>Private key</b>: A key which used by receiver
 - <b>Certificate</b>: Electronic document which contains information about key, name, etc.
 - <b>Digitally signed certificate</b>: Certificate encrypted by public key of CA
 - <b>Certificate Authority (CA)</b>: Trusted Third party who serves certificate of a particular person
 - <b>Root certificate authority</b>: Top most party in the certificate authority hierarchy
 - <b>Session key</b>: Unique token generated by server to identify the user between client and server
 - <b>Figure print/Checksum</b>: Hashed value to ensures integrity of the certificate while in transit
