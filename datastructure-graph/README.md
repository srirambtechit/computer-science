<h5>Graph terminology</h5>
<pre>
 - Vertex
 - Edge
 - Cycle graph
 - Degree
</pre>

<h5>Graph representation</h5>
 - Vertex representation
 - Set of edges representation
 - Adjacency matrix representation
 - Adjacency list representation

<h5>Graph Traversal</h5>
 - Breadth First Search - uses queue
 - Depth First Search - uses stack

<h5>Types of Graph</h5>
 - Undirected graph
 - Directed graph (or) Digraph
 - Weighted Undirected/Digraph
 - DAG (or) Directed Acyclic Graph

<i><b>Applications</b></i>

 - control flow - coding

<i><b>Problems</b></i>
 - <b>Path</b> Is there a directed path from s to t?
 - <b>Shortest path</b> What is the shortest path from s to t?
 - <b>Topological sort</b> Can you draw a digraph so that all edges point upwards?
 - <b>Strong connectivity</b> Is there a directed path between all pairs of vertices?
 - <b>Transitive closure</b> For which vertices v and w is there a path from v and w?
 - <b>PageRank</b> What is the importance of web page?
 - <b>Cycle</b> Given a digraph, find a directed cycle?
 - <b>Reverse Graph<b> Reverse the given Graph.
 
<i><b>Definition</b><i>
<p><b>Topological order: </b> Linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed
edge UV from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering</p>
