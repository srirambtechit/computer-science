Problems:
 - <b>Path</b> Is there a directed path from s to t?
 - <b>Shortest path</b> What is the shortest path from s to t?
 - <b>Topological sort</b> Can you draw a digraph so that all edges point upwards?
 - <b>Strong connectivity</b> Is there a directed path between all pairs of vertices?
 - <b>Transitive closure</b> For which vertices v and w is there a path from v and w?
 - <b>PageRank</b> What is the importance of web page?
